user_description: |-
  The goal of the project is to create an agentic chatbot that can provide runners training plans for upcoming races (for mvp, we'll focus on marathons) to help runners accomplish their goals. The project should use an agentic orchestration workflow (think LangGraph) where users can have back-and-forth conversations with "Coach George", the avatar for this chatbot. Coach George will consult with other agents to come up with a dynamic workout plan & schedule. There should be a data analytics agent to account for trends in a user's runs (distance, speed, heartrate, etc.). There should be a physical therapist agent to advocate for the runner if they've suffered injuries, and will come up with a program to slowly reintegrate the runner back into the training. Long term, the app should be integrated with smart watches, like Garmin, to automatically receive workout data and kickoff the agentic workflow to strategize the next workout.
