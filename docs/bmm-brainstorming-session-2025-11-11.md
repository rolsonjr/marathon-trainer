# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-11-11
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** Rodney

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** runner personalization logic for Coach George

**Session Goals:** design resume-worthy personalization behaviors for a non-production MVP

**Techniques Used:** First Principles Thinking; Role Playing; Analogical Thinking

**Total Ideas Generated:** 9

### Key Themes Identified:

- Metric-driven personalization anchored by race goals and weekly feedback
- Multi-agent orchestration: analytics drives mastery, PT enforces safety, Coach George communicates
- Adaptive learning analogy: mastery scores unlock progressions and remediation

## Technique Sessions

1. **First Principles Thinking**
   - Identified indispensable inputs: race target/timeline, baseline fitness, readiness signals, execution vs plan, schedule blockers
   - Established personalization loop: weekly plan -> execution feedback -> plan adjustment
2. **Role Playing**
   - Coach George tone: firm accountability, positive reinforcement, supportive recalibration
   - Data Analytics agent: parses FIT data, computes load/fatigue/zone adherence, prescribes plan tweaks
   - Physical Therapist agent: supportive recovery programs, firm pushback when load endangers runner
3. **Analogical Thinking (Adaptive Learning)**
   - Mastery tracking per workout type (tempo, long, intervals, recovery)
   - Consistent mastery unlocks tougher progressions; struggles trigger remedial drills
   - Coach George reports mastery to runner for transparency

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

- Build weekly personalization engine using five core inputs
- Establish mastery scoring + analytics insights pipeline
- Implement PT agent safeguards with recovery recommendations

### Future Innovations

- Spaced repetition of drills when mastery decays
- Adaptive messaging personas based on runner profiles

### Moonshots

- Fully automated Garmin sync triggering real-time plan updates
- Sentiment-aware Coach George dialogue driven by wearable signals

### Insights and Learnings

- Mastery framing clarifies how analytics and coaching stay in sync
- Role clarity prevents conflicting advice between agents
- Lightweight MVP can still feel premium if mastery + empathy are visible

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Weekly personalization engine

- Rationale: Core loop showcasing Coach George’s intelligence; aligns plan to goals + schedule
- Next steps: Model five input buckets; design weekly adjustment algorithm; script Coach George messaging states
- Resources needed: Simple planner logic, prompt templates, mock schedule + workout data
- Timeline: 1 week to prototype messaging + adjustment logic

#### #2 Priority: Mastery tracking + analytics insights

- Rationale: Distinguishes MVP by quantifying runner proficiency via FIT signals
- Next steps: Define mastery scoring rubric; parse sample FIT data; map scores to progression/remediation rules
- Resources needed: FIT parser or sample dataset, simple metrics calculator
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks for parsing + scoring prototype

#### #3 Priority: Physical therapist safeguard layer

- Rationale: Adds empathy + safety, showing multi-agent collaboration on resume
- Next steps: Define injury trigger thresholds; script PT responses; integrate recovery prescriptions into plan adjustments
- Resources needed: Injury heuristics, stretch/recovery library, messaging templates
- Timeline: 1 week to draft guardrails + scripts

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- Technique variety kept ideation focused yet creative
- Adaptive learning analogy grounded personalization logic

### Areas for Further Exploration

- Explore how mastery scores feed into long-term periodization

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- SCAMPER on Coach George dialogues
- Five Whys on injury prevention strategy

### Questions That Emerged

- How to visualize mastery to users without overwhelming them?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** UX flows for Coach George, telemetry ingestion design
- **Recommended timeframe:** Within 1-2 weeks after initial prototypes
- **Preparation needed:** Mock data samples, draft UI sketches
